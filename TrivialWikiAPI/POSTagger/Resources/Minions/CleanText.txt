This is a redirect from a plural noun to its singular form. Either {{R from plural}} or {{R to singular}} may be used to tag plural redirects. For more information follow the bold category link.
This redirect link is used for convenience; it is often preferable to add the plural directly after the link .
Use this rcat to tag only mainspace redirects; when plural forms are found in other namespaces, use {{R from modification}} instead.
